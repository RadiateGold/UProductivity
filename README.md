# UProductivity

**Problem:** 
College freshmen can have a difficult time figuring out their 4-year plan with all of the various requirements that need to be fulfilled.

**Description of Project:** 
This web app helps users (specifically Computer Science BS majors) create 4-year plans by allowing them to input courses they have taken, are taking, or are planning to take, and showing them the requirements they have fulfilled and those they haven't through an appealing and easy-to-understand interface.

See UProductivity.md for a link to the web app.

**Contributors:** 
* Tyler Hecht (back-end coding)
* Benita Abraham (web scraping)
* Aparna Roy (front-end coding)

**Future Directions:** 
We will continue to make this web app better by...
* Accounting for prerequisites and corequisites
* Extending the app's functionality to more majors at the University of Delaware
* Accounting for minors at the University of Delaware
* Better accounting for concentrations
* Automatically selecting the corresponding number of credits for each course that the user inputs
* Including an area to input transfer credits/courses (from high school or other colleges) and accounting for those
* Improving the interface of the web app to make it more appealing
